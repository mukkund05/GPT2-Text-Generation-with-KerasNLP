## Introduction

This project showcases the implementation of the GPT-2 model for text generation using the KerasNLP library. The GPT-2 model, developed by OpenAI, is known for its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on the input provided.

## Features

- **Text Generation:** Generate text based on a given prompt.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust parameters like maximum length, temperature, and top-k for text generation.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple and intuitive code structure for easy understanding and modification.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Ensure you have the necessary dependencies:**
    - Python 3.x
    - TensorFlow
    - KerasNLP

## Usage

To use the text generation script, follow these steps:

1. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python gpt2_text_generation_with_kerasnlp.py
    ```

2. **Provide input prompts:**
    - The script will prompt you to enter text based on which it will generate the output.

3. **Customize parameters:**
    - You can modify the script to adjust the maximum length, temperature, and top-k sampling parameters to fine-tune the generated text.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of text generation using this project:

1. **Prompt:** "Once upon a time"
    - **Generated Text:** "Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a young princess who dreamed of exploring the world beyond her castle walls..."

2. **Prompt:** "In the future"
    - **Generated Text:** "In the future, humanity will colonize Mars and establish thriving cities, complete with schools, hospitals, and recreational centers..."
